✈️ Air Canada Customer Seat Choice Prediction Model

📌 Overview

This project develops a machine learning model to predict Air Canada customers' seat purchase decisions—whether they opt for ADVANCE, PREFERRED, or make NO PURCHASE. By analyzing pricing strategies, seat availability, and customer preferences, this model aims to optimize revenue and improve customer experience.

📂 Dataset

The dataset participant_data.csv consists of various factors influencing seat selection, including:

Ticket Purchase Date – When the ticket was booked.

Flight Date – Scheduled departure date.

Price – Cost of each seat category.

Seat Availability – Number of available seats in each category.

Trip Details – Flight duration, origin, and destination.

Customer Preferences – Historical purchasing behavior, loyalty status, etc.

Weekday/Weekend Indicator – Identifies if the flight falls on a weekday or weekend.

🤖 Model Details

The predictive model is built using machine learning techniques with a focus on performance and accuracy:

Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier

Evaluation Metric: F1 Score (to balance precision and recall)

Current Model Accuracy: ~93% (Ongoing optimization for improvement)
